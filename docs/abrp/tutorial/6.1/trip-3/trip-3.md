ABRP attempts to create the most expeditious route between your starting point and the destination you pick. Sometimes you'd like to take a "less efficient" route along the road less traveled. ABRP will let you do that too.

## Choosing Your Own Adventure

#### Guidepoints

**Guidepoints** are locations that you pass through (without a planned stop) on your way to your destination. You can use guidepoints to tell ABRP how you'd like to get to the destination.

If you want to plan stops at interesting points along the way, add them as **waypoints** (as opposed to as guidepoints) will cause ABRP to calculate your arrival time at the way point and will display the waypoint on the [next stop tile](../ui/driving-view/next-stop-tile/index.html)

#### Adding a Ferry To Your Route

If you right-click in a body of water near a ferry route, a context menu will appear with an option to **Add ferry line.** Selecting that option causes ABRP to include the ferry in your route. Adding a ferry is a bit different than adding a guidepoint. ABRP will offer to add the  ferry line nearest to the point where you clicked, so you don't have to click precisely on the ferry line.
