Tesla has opened up Supercharger access for non-Tesla vehicles. To use a Supercharger you'll need:

* A supported vehicle. Tesla [maintains a list of supported vehicles](https://www.tesla.com/support/charging/supercharging-other-evs#vehicles) on their website.
* Either:
  - A NACS adapter, or
  - To stop at a Supercharger with a "Magic Dock" adapter (essentially a NACS adapter that is part of the Supercharger post), or
  - A EV that was built with a NACS charging port.
* The Tesla app

## Charging a non-Tesla EV at a Supercharger

On Tesla's website there are [instructions for charging non-Tesla vehicles](https://www.tesla.com/support/charging/supercharging-other-evs#charge-if-not-tesla-vehicle). As I write this, they are basically: install the app, create an account, follow the instructions.

There are some subtlties, so let me expand a bit...

### Setup the Tesla App

1. Download the Tesla app.
1. Create an account.
1. Add a credit card and your EV(s) to your profile.

### Find a Supercharger

There are three Supercharger variations:
1. Tesla-only Superchargers -- older (I assume) Superchargers that have not been updated to work with non-Tesla EVs. You shouldn't get routed to these or have them suggested to you in the Tesla or Plugshare apps, but if you're driving by...
1. "Public" Superchargers that are "open to non-Tesla EVs." You can charge a supported vehile at these Superchargers but you may need to bring your own NACS adapter.
1. "Magic Dock" Superchargers: these are public Superchargers with their own CCS adapters.

In addition to the will work / won't work / must have your own adapter distinctions, later, "Version 4" Superchargers have longer cables that make it easier to be a good neighbor while charging a non-Tesla car. [Supercharge.info](https://supercharge.info/map) maintains a map that makes it very easy to see the type of charger that you are heading to.

As long as you have an NACS adapter, any public Supercharger should work for you.

There are a number of ways to find a Supercharger:
* The most convinient is to let ABRP (or another "NACS aware" routing app) find one for you.
* Use Find a Charger feature in the Tesla app to locate a compatible Tesla Supercharger.
* Use Plugshare to find one.

### Charge

1. At the Supercharger, park where the cable can reach your port. This may be the hardest part of the whole process. Tesla cars all have their charging port on the driver's side rear corner of the car. Off hand, I can't think of any other EVs that have the charging port there. Since Superchargers "know" (or knew) where the charging port is the cables are just long enough for a Tesla that is backed in at the charger.
1. Plug Supercharger cable into your NACS adapter. If you plug the adapter into your car before connecting the Supercharger cable, the car may start its negotiation process with the charger before you get the cable plugged in and decide that the charger isn't working. KIAs do this.
1. Plug adapter into car
1. Choose the post number (1A, 2C etc) in the Tesla app, tap Start Charge in the app.
1. Stop charge using the car screen: EV Settings-->DC Charge Limit: drag the charge limit % bar left until charge stops (blipping the release tab on the adapter also works)
1. Unplug the Supercharger cable from the NACS adapter
1. Unplug adapter from car
