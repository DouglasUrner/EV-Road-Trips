This tutorial will introduce you to planning road trips in your EV using [A Better Route Planner](https://abetterrouteplanner.com).

## [Getting Started](6.1/getting-started.md)

## Planning Trips

We'll plan three trips that will illustrate some common uses of ABRP

### [First Time Out: A Short Drive in Town](6.1/trip-1.md)

For this one our goal is to get ABRP set up and start getting familiar with the ABRP user interface (UI) by planning a short local trip. You'll plan the trip using the ABRP website and then actually drive the route using ABRP on your phone.
