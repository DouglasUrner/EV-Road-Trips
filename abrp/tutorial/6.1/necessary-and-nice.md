To get started, all you need is a device with a web browser, the A Better Route Planner (ABRP) website lets you explore the planning features and get a sense of how the driving mode works. So, there is no reason not to dive in and see if ABRP might work for you.

If you think it's a go, then a phone is pretty much required if you want to use ABRP for navigation and real-time monitoring of your energy consumption (and thus range and charging options). The list below breaks down the gear that you need or might want.

# Essential

* A phone that can run the **A Better Route Planner** app -- pretty much any relatively modern phone running Android or iOS should fill the bill.
* The A Better Route Planner (ABRP) app, you can download it from the your phone's app store.
  - Android: []()
  - iOS: []()
* A cable to charge your phone & connect to Android Auto or Apple CarPlay (even if your car has wireless charging & supports a wireless connection to Android Auto or Car Play). Wired connections seem less likely to result an overheated phone going on strike at an inopportune momement.
* A hands free mount for your phone is essential if you don't have Android Auto or CarPlay (or if you don't want to pay for the ABRP subscription). Even with them a mount is quite handy since ABRP displays some useful extra information on the phone while you're driving -- most noteably the battery temperature.

# Very Useful

* An ODB2 "dongle," this device plugs into the diagnostic port on your car and allows ABRP to monitor your battery in real-time. Not all dongles are created equal: security, compatibility with ABRP, reliability, and energy consumption are all considerations. There is [more discussion and a list](https://www.iternio.com/abrp-obd) of known-to-work (and known-not-to-work) dongles on the Iternio website. Two reasonable options are:
  - [ODBLink CX]()
  - [Vgate vLinker MC+]()
* The app for your ODB2 dongle. It may come in handy for testing or troubleshooting, and if you're inclinded to nerd out on data it can be a nice distraction during charging stops.

# Nice To Have

* A laptop or desktop computer for planning.
* The ChargePoint app.
* Apps for any of the charging networks that you use on a regular basis.

# Optional

* A NACS (North American Charging Standard aka Tesla) adapter if your car has a CCS plug, or a CCS adapter if your car has a NACS plug.
