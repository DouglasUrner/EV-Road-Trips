# Getting Started With A Better Route Planner

[**A Better Route Planner**](https://abetterrouteplanner.com) (ABRP) is a tool for planning EV road trips. It attempts to take into account the important factors affecting the range of your EV -- the speed you like to drive at, the weather along the route, the ups and downs of the road, the wind direction.[^1] ABRP does a remarkably good job of calculating the energy your car will need to get to your destination. Compared to the "guess-o-meter" range estimates provided by many EVs, ABRP's estimates are very reassuringly precise and consistant.

ABRP plans routes by looking at your vehicles range, the available charging stations, and your destination. With that information it plans a route to drive and where to stop to charge.

Once you start driving ABRP can provide route guidance[^2] and monitor your actual energy consumption. If conditions change and your energy consumption isn't matching the plan you'll be able to see that and ABRP will warn you and offer alternative charging stops.

You can plan routes on your computer using the ABRP website (https://abetterrouteplanner.com) or on a phone running either iOS or Android. For use on the road, you'll almost certianly want to use the ABRP app on your phone. If your car supports Apple CarPlay or Android Auto you may find that it's worth the money for an ABRP subscription.

## Why Use ABRP?

Your car almost certainly has a built-in navigation system. It might even be pretty good. So why would you want to consider using a third-party route planning and navigation system? Here's why I use it:

* ABRP works on all of the EVs that I drive (and have driven), it saves me from having to learn the ins and outs of the navigation system in a new car. It also allows my partner and I to use the same navigation system even though we drive different makes of EVs. Having a navigation system that I know how to use makes driving rental cars much less stressful.
* ABRP's planning and range estimation is very good. That makes long drives, especially in unfamiliar country much less stressful.
* The ABRP developers and support staff are *way* more responsive than the folks at KIA or GM. Iternio actually publishes a development roadmap for ABRP. The ABRP community of users is a great source of information about using ABRP and EV travel in general.
* I don't know this for sure, but it seems that Iternio (the company behind ABRP) probably has less ability to track your activity and connect it to a vehicle in a way that would enable them to monetize knowledege about how or where you drive. I think ABRP is less of a privacy risk than the built-in navigation.

[^1]: These are all factors that also effect the range of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines, but while gas stations are plentiful and generally easy to find, EV charging stations are not -- especially in rural areas and on less traveled roads.

[^2]: ABRP can also export routes to Apple Maps and Google Maps if you prefer to use them for guidance as you drive. This has the advantage of letting you use an navigation display that is more refined and which may be more familiar to you -- the downside is that you won't be able to take advantage of ABRP's ability to monitor your real-time energy consumption and assist with finding alternate charging stations if the plan isn't working.
